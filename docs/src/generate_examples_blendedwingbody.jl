    In this example we analyze a blended wing body that is generated from CAD
    (SolidWorks).
    We show how to import the NURBS geometry into [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info) to generate an
    unstructured watertight mesh with arbitrary regions of refinement, which is
    then read by FLOWPanel using [Meshes.jl](https://juliageometry.github.io/MeshesDocs).

    To run this tutorial you will have to install a few dependencies for
    processing unstructured grids:
    ```julia
    import Pkg

    Pkg.add(Meshes)
    Pkg.add(GeoIO)
    Pkg.add(Rotations)
    ```

    0. Import STEP file
        * `File > Merge`

    1. Create physical group with all NURBS surfaces
        * Make sure that geometric surfaces are visible: `Tools > Options > Geometry > Visibility > Surfaces`
        * Create physical group: `Modules > Geometry > Physical Groups > Add > Surface`
        * Press `CTRL + Right Click` to box-select
        ![pic](http://edoalvar2.groups.et.byu.net/public/FLOWPanel/gmsh000.png)

    2. Create criterion for refinement at LE
        * `Modules > Mesh > Define > Size fields`
        * Define leading edge lines: `Distance` with `CurvesList` set to 33,25,53,45 and 1000 for `NumPointsPercurve`
        * Define transition lines: `Distance` with `CurvesList` set to 18,19,56,54 and 1000 for `NumPointsPercurve`
        * Define upper-bound lines of leading edge: `Distance` with `CurvesList` set to 30, 22, 55, 47 and 1000 for `NumPointsPercurve`
        * Define lower-bound lines of leading edge: `Distance` with `CurvesList` set to 35, 28, 51, 43 and 1000 for `NumPointsPercurve`
        * Define cell size based on distance to leading edge: `MathEval` with the formula `1.5*(F1^1.2 + 500/F2^0.5)/2 + 30`
        * Define cell size based on thickness of leading edge: `MathEval` with the formula `3*((5*F1+F3+F4)/7)^1.5 + 5`
        * Mix both cell sizes: `Min` with `FieldsList` set to 5,6, select "Set as background field" and click Apply. Defined this way, it refines the mesh in the proximity of the LE lines based on LE thickness, while transitioning the refinement close to the transition lines.

    3. Set mesher settings
        * Set size factor: `Tools > Options > Mesh > General > Element size factor` and set to `0.1`
        * Select `MeshAdapt` for the 2D algorithm

    4. Mesh the NURBS surface
        * Discretize 1D curves: `Modules > Mesh > 1D`
        * Discretize 2D surfaces: `Modules > Mesh > 2D`
        * Smooth out the discretization by clicking `Modules > Mesh > Smooth 2D` a few times

    5. Export mesh as `.msh` in ASCII format v4: `File > Export` and select `Mesh - Gmsh MSH (*.msh)` in the dropdown menu

        ```
    """
    )

    println(fout, """

    !!! tip "Checklist for importing meshes"
        1. **Check whether normals point into the body:** Using the flag
            `debug=true` in `pnl.save(body, run_name; path=save_path, debug=true)`
            will output the control points of the body along with the associated
            normal vector of each panel.
                We recommend opening the body and controls points in ParaView and
            visualizing the normals with the Glyph filter.
                Whenever the normals are pointing into the body, the user needs
            to flip the offset of the
            control points with `CPoffset=-1e-14` or any other negligibly small
            negative number. This won't flip the normals outwards, but it will flip
            the zero-potential domain from outwards back to inside the body
            (achieved by shifting the control points slightly into the body).
        2. **Check that the trailing edge was correctly identified:**
            `pnl.save(body, run_name; path=save_path)` automatically outputes the
            wake.
                We recommend opening the body and wake in ParaView and visually
            inspecting that the wake runs along the trailing edge line that you
            defined under `trailingedge`.
                If not successful, increase the resolution of `trailingedge` and tighten
            the tolerance to something small like
            `pnl.calc_shedding(grid, trailingedge; tolerance=0.0001*span)`.
        3. **Choose the right solver for the geometry:**
            Use the least-squares solver with watertight bodies
            (`bodytype = pnl.RigidWakeBody{pnl.VortexRing, 2}`), and the direct
            linear solve with open bodies
            (`bodytype = pnl.RigidWakeBody{pnl.VortexRing}`). The least-squares
            solver runs much faster in GPU
            (`pnl.solve(body, Uinfs, Das, Dbs; GPUArray=CUDA.CuArray{Float32})`),
            but it comes at the price of sacrificing accuracy (single precision
            numbers as opposed to double).

    ## CPU Multi-Threading

    The kernels and solvers implemented in FLOWPanel are parallelized (threaded)
    in CPU by default.
    However, in order to activate the CPU parallelization, the user needs to
    [launch Julia with multi-threading activated](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/#Starting-Julia-with-multiple-threads).
    For instance, to launch Julia with 4 threads type
    ```bash
    \$ julia --threads 4
    ```

    You can then verify that the 4 threads became available:

    ```julia-repl
    julia> Threads.nthreads()
    4
    ```

    ## Porting to GPU

    The solver can be seamlessly ported to GPU by indicating the type of
    array to be used internally.
    [The Julia GPU interface](https://juliagpu.org/) is the same for any GPU hardware and platform
    (NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm, and Mac Metal), however, we have only tested NVIDIA
    GPUs.

    For an NVIDIA GPU, in the previous section import the CUDA package,
    ```julia-repl
    julia> import CUDA
    ```
    check that the GPU hardware is ready to be used,
    ```julia-repl
    julia> CUDA.functional()
    true
    ```
    and instead of letting the solver default its internal arrays to CPU, change
    the solver call from
    ```julia-repl
    julia> pnl.solve(body, Uinfs, Das, Dbs)
    ```
    to
    ```julia-repl
    julia> pnl.solve(body, Uinfs, Das, Dbs; GPUArray=CUDA.CuArray{Float32})
    ```

    For AMD GPU:
    ```julia-repl
    julia> import AMDGPU
    julia> AMDGPU.functional()
    true
    julia> AMDGPU.functional(:MIOpen)
    true
    julia> pnl.solve(body, Uinfs, Das, Dbs; GPUArray=AMDGPU.ROCArray{Float32})
    ```

    For Metal GPU:
    ```julia-repl
    julia> import Metal
    julia> Metal.functional()
    true
    julia> pnl.solve(body, Uinfs, Das, Dbs; GPUArray=Metal.MtlArray{Float32})
    ```
