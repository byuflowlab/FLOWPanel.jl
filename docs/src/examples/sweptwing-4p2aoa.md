In this example we solve the flow around a $45^\circ$ swept-back wing at an
angle of attack of $4.2^\circ$ using a rigid wake model.

# $4.2^\circ$ Angle of Attack
```julia
#=##############################################################################
# DESCRIPTION
    45deg swept-back wing at an angle of attack of 4.2deg. This wing has an
    aspect ratio of 5.0, a RAE 101 airfoil section with 12% thickness, and no
    dihedral, twist, nor taper. This test case matches the experimental setup
    of Weber, J., and Brebner, G., “Low-Speed Tests on 45-deg Swept-Back Wings,
    Part I,” Tech. rep., 1951.

#= NOTE: Here we loft each side of the wing independently. One could also loft
        the entire wing at once from left tip to right tip, but the sweep of the
        wing would lead to an asymmetric discretization with the panels of left
        side side would have a higher aspect ratio than those of the right side.
        To avoid that, instead we loft the left side from left to right, then we
        loft to right side from right to left, and we combine left and right
        sides into a MultiBody that represents the wing.
