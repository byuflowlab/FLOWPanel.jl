The flow field around a body is given by the vortex filaments that make the edges of the panel, and the strength of each filament is simply the difference between adjacent panels. Thus, in the absence of an open edge (like in a watertight geometry), the strengths of the vortex-ring elements become irrelevant, and the problem is purely determined by the difference in strength between adjacent panels. This leads to an overdetermined problem where one of the original degrees of freedom (panels strengths) has become redundant.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/duct-leastsquares/","page":"Least-Squares Solver","title":"Least-Squares Solver","text":"Let n the number of panels.

However, for a watertight geometry, G is no longer full rank and the problem becomes ill-conditioned.

However, the user is free to define wings in any arbitrary convention since the solvers are indifferent to orientation. Unless otherwise indicated, the solvers are indifferent to whether normals point inside or outside the geometry, but for consistency, it is good practice to define the geometry such as to have the normals pointing outside. This is done by building every airfoil starting at the trailing edge first going around the bottom side towards the leading edge, and going back to the trailing edge around the top side, while using b_low < b_up.","category":"page"},{"location":"geometry/gridgeneration-loft/","page":"Lofting Method","title":"Lofting Method","text":"Following these guidelines, GeometricTools.generate_loft returns a lofted quadrilateral surface with the following node and cell indexing pattern:","category":"page"},{"location":"geometry/gridgeneration-loft/","page":"Lofting Method","title":"Lofting Method","text":"\n<center>\n  <table>\n      <tr>\n          <th>\n              <center>First Coordinate</center>\n          </th>\n          <th>\n              <center>Second Coordinate</center>\n          </th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n          <td>\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/loft-quad-cellcoordinate03.png\" alt=\"Pic here\" width=\"450px\">\n          </td>\n          <td>\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/loft-quad-cellcoordinate02.png\" alt=\"Pic here\" width=\"450px\">\n          </td>\n      </tr>\n  </table>\n</center>\n\n<br><br>\n\n<center>\n  <table>\n      <tr>\n          <th>\n              <center>Node Index</center>\n          </th>\n          <th>\n              <center>Cell Index</center>\n          </th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n          <td>\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/loft-quad-nodeindex00.png\" alt=\"Pic here\" width=\"450px\">\n          </td>\n          <td>\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/loft-quad-cellindex01.png\" alt=\"Pic here\" width=\"450px\">\n          </td>\n      </tr>\n  </table>\n</center>\n\n<br><br>\n\n<center>\n  <table>\n      <tr>\n          <th>\n              <center>Cell (1, 1)</center>\n          </th>\n          <th>\n              <center>Cell (16, 1)</center>\n          </th>\n          <th>\n              <center>Cell (15, 2)</center>\n          </th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n          <td>\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/loft-quad-cellnodes00.0000.png\" alt=\"Pic here\" width=\"450px\">\n          </td>\n          <td>\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/loft-quad-cellnodes00.0001.png\" alt=\"Pic here\" width=\"450px\">\n          </td>\n          <td>\n              <img src=\"../../assets/images/loft-quad-cellnodes00.0002.png\" alt=\"Pic here\" width=\"450px\">\n          </td>\n      </tr>\n  </table>\n</center>","category":"page"},{"location":"geometry/gridgeneration-loft/#Example-—-Wing,-uniform-mesh","page":"Lofting Method","title":"Example — Wing, uniform mesh","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"geometry/gridgeneration-loft/","page":"Lofting Method","title":"Lofting Method","text":"Here is a wing with a 5-th order spline.
